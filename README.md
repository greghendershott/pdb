This is WIP exploring the idea of populating a sqlite database of
defintions and uses discovered from running drracket/check-syntax.

Some comments at the bottom of `db.rkt` give some context about how
this might be used with something like Racket Mode's back end.
Although that's my immediate motivating example, the idea is that it
could also complement the Dr Racket GUI IDE or other tools.
