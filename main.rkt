;; When the database contains many file analyses -- for example the

;; files -- rename-sites will be extremely slow searching all those

;; under a certain prefix. For example a user could limit this to
;; files within a certain project.
;;
;; NOTE: A predicate would be more flexible. But we need to give
;; sqlite a "LIKE /path/to/%" clause. If a single prefix isn't
;; flexible enough, instead this could be a list of prefixes, and we
;; could do a series of such queries.
;;
;; NOTE: The speed issue per se could also be addressed by building
;; some index from path+ibk to path -- that is, an index from exports
;; to files that use the exports. This could make things somewhat
;; faster for the case where the user really does want to search all
;; 8,000 files. On the other hand, indexes aren't free; this would add
;; space, and, would shift some time spent from queries to updates. It
;; might be worthwhile. I'm leery of doing updates where analyze-path
;; takes an extra second or more, due to inserting too many rows in
;; the sqlite table, as with the originally design that used db tables
