;; 1. One idea here would be to replace the Racket Mode back end
;; check-syntax code with this: The front end would request an
;; analysis, the back end would notify when it's ready, and the front
;; end would issue commands to discover info for various ranges of the
;; buffer. Unclear if it would still propertize text ranges with
;; some/all of that returned info, or instead, if it could just query
;; the back end as needed. Although this could probably work, it would
;; be slower. Our analysis here takes ~ 1.5X to 2X the time, due to db
;; writing/reading overhead. [OTOH it might be a way to contribute to
;; fixing the "streaming for very large source files" issue samth
;; reported.]
;;
;; 2. So another idea is that the RMBE would still do and return its
;; analysis, status quo. It's just that, /in addition/, it would
;; submit these results to the db -- presumably using another thread
;; that doesn't delay the command response to the front end. That way,
;; the front end check-sytnax would not change in method or timing.
;; However, we could support RM commands (and external tools) that use
;; inter-file references. Also, we could get rid of the RMBE's syntax
;; caching, I think: Things like find-definition need not walk
;; fully-expanded syntax to look for the definition site -- we already
;; did that and saved the result for all possible definitions,
;; beforehand. That is just a db query. (I'm not sure about
;; find-signature: maybe we could add a pass to walk non-expanded
;; syntax, and store that extra info in a new column in the `defs`
;; table, or, store it in a new `sigs` table.)
